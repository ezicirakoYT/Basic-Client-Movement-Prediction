## About
This is pretty much my first time trying to make one of these nice #Readmes
anyway this is a basic Client prediction uses ping of clients to find player's actual position
It's generally correct but also kinda buggy and requires more work but maybe that for later

## Installation
- Create a "UnreliableRemoteEvent" in game.ReplicatedStorage
- Copy Client.luau and create a localscript in PlayerScripts and paste code
- Copy Server.luau and create a script in ServerScriptService and paste code

Boom you are done.
